# Remote Firmware update instructions.

Follow the following steps to update the firmware.

1. Download the firmware file. This should be provided to you by different means (email, link, etc.)
1. Start the remote in firmware update mode. This can be done by holding the button 0 while turning on the remote. Instead of glowing magenta, the 
remote will show a red glow.
1. Open the [remote update web app page](https://turingcompletelabs.com/firmware). Unfortunately this requires a Mac/PC/Laptop with bluetooth and Chrome (for now).
1. Click on the "CONNECT" button on the page and allow the page to scan for bluetooth devices. A list of devices should appear, pick the right one.
1. Once the remote is connected to the web app, the "Select file" will enable. Pick the firmware.bin from the location you saved it.
1. Finally click send to update the remote.

If the process is successful the remote will reboot with the new firmware. If there are errors, they will appear in the log section.

Thanks
