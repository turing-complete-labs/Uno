Thank you for getting a VNO remote!

## Setting up the watch for the first time

Turn on the device and wait for the purple LED to start slowly blinking green. 
Green blinking means that the remote has never been paired with a watch and it's looking for a device to pair. This might take a bit long depending on the astral conjunctions and the watch battery freshness. 
Once a suitable device is found, the LED will turn yellow to indicate pairing. This might be so quick to be unnoticeable. Once the remote is ready, the LED will turn off and a one second vibration indicate that the pairing was successful.
Should the watch go out of range from the remote, the remote will start emitting a "heart-beat" vibration until the watch is back in range. A successful reconnection will be prompted by the one second vibration.

NOTE: disconnect/reconnect events are all signaled through vibrations, the LED will never turn on until the remote is restarted.

## Standard remote turn-on steps

Once the watch and the remote are paired, turning on the remote will automatically put it in search of the previously paired device. The remote will start emitting a "heart-beat" vibration until the watch is connected, signaled by the one second vibration. No green-yellow LED lights will be turned on since the remote already knows which watch to connect with.

## Unpairing the remote

Press the button on the back of the remote with a pin. The LED will turn blue, green, yellow and red to signal the factory reset. Factory reset won't restart until the LED turns RED to avoid accidental reset. Once this happens the remote is in like new state ready to be paired with a new watch. Or the same. Follow the "Setting up the watch for the first time" paragraph.

## Using the remote

They keypad is made up of two distinct areas: the numeric pad (1 through 0), and the bottom buttons named Left (L) and Right (R).
Compose the time to send to the watch by using the numeric pad. The remote will send the time to the watch when:
The forth digit is pressed (example 4 in 12:34)
The third digit is pressed and it's not possible to add a fourth one (example 7 in 1:27)
The third digit is pressed, the fourth digit is "optional" and enough time has passed (example waiting a few secs after pressing 3 in 1:23)
The remote will emit a short vibration for each keypress. Successful setting of the time will be signaled by a three second variation.
Invalid time (e.g. 3:79) will be signaled with four short vibrations.
If you are in the middle of composing a time and you made a mistake, you can restart the composition by pressing any digit for a little longer (almost a second). A long vibration will signal the remote is ready to start again.

The (L) button is used for setting the watch on the current time for the models that support this (SBWatch). 
The (R) button has 2 functions:
Short press, it will cause the LED to blink with a color depending on the battery status. See table in appendix for an explanation of what the colors mean.
Long press, it will put the remote to sleep, ready to be restarted with a single key press. Hold this button until the remote emits 4 short vibrations and the LED dims from red to off. This is because the main switch is purposely placed in a way that's really hard to turn on/off accidentally by fiddling in your pocket. So for those times when you need to get ready a bit ahead, it's possible to turn on the remote from the main switch and set it to sleep to save battery knowing that a single press will turn on the remote back.

## Battery

UNO's battery should last hours, but should the battery start to get low, the LED will turn on weak yellow.
If the battery charge is below critical, the LED will turn on red and the remote will stop working until recharged enough.

## Important tip
Batteries degrade quickly if they are left to uncharge completely. If the remote is left accidentally on, letting the battery drain fully will cause permanent damage. The tip is ABC: always be charging. Of course as "always" as possible.

## Firmware upgrade

I tested UNO extensively but in case of bugs is possible to get a FW upgrade to address it. The procedure will be handled through a webpage and a supported browser (Chrome on PC or Mac).

## Appendix

### Table 1 - Vibrations

Single short vibration after turning on: the remote is working.
Single short vibration: keypress
Single long vibration: long keypress, it depends on the key. See above.
Heartbeat vibration continuous (every 4 secs): the paired device is out of range.
Single long vibration after heartbeat: the device successfully reconnected.
Three consecutive short vibrations: factory reset completed.
Two second long vibration: the hands on the watch are now set.
Two short, pause, two short: the time entered is invalid (eg. 3:81)
Four quick vibrations: the device is turning off in sleep mode.

### Table 2 - LED color blink battery code (after pressing the R button)

One long green flash (battery fully charged)
Two green flashes (battery charged)
One green flash (battery ok)
One yellow flash (battery low)
One long red flash (battery approaching to critical, please get ready to recharge)
